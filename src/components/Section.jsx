        El-ca√±onazo is an event for all the tech enthusiasts to use their innovative and technical mind simultaneously
        and create a shooting mechanism from the best use of available resources.</p>
        <p>The aim of the event is to design a shooting mechanism consisting of at least three links, which can hit a
        target at a minimum distance of 5 meters. The participants will be provided with all the necessary knowledge,
        equipments of the workshop and proper assistance required for crafting their shooting mechanism.</p>
      <p> The evaluation of the mechanism will be based on Functionality and reliability of mechanism, Originality/Degree
        of Innovation, Manufacturability, Feasibility and stability of mechanism, Scientific / Engineering basis of
        design, Cost and weight analysis.
